To build my personal copy of Z+Angband using Microsoft's Visual Studio.
Using the directx 9 PNG file loader:

 1. Download the source from https://github.com/blubaron/z-angband or clone
    the git repostitory at https://github.com/blubaron/z-angband.

 2. Make an empty win32 application project in visual studio.

 3. Extract/copy the source code into the project directory. Make sure that 
    the src directory is in the project directory, rather than in another
    subdirectory.

 4. In the project settings, in the C/C++ tab, in the additional include
    directories ilne, add: src, src/platform/win.

 5. In the project settings, also in the Link tab, remove any directory names
    (usually Debug\ or Release\) from in front of the executable name. Doing
    this will put the executeable in the project directory so you do not have
    to move it every time the project is compiled.

 6. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src directory to the
    project files.  This can be done by right-clicking on the project in
    visual studio and choosing "Add Files to Project" from the context menu
    or by going to "Project" -> "Add to Project" -> "Files" from the menu bar.

 7. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\platform\win
    directory to the project, as well as zplus.rc.

 8. Save the project, then compile the project. There will be a lot of
    warnings, but there should not be any errors. The warnings can be ignored.

 9. If there are no errors, enjoy playing z+angband. There should not be any
    errors and the executable should be built. If there are any errors, and
    you do not know how to fix them, you can ask on the Variant forum at
    http://angband.oook.cz. Please make sure to mention that you are using my
    personal version, rather than the official version of z+Angband.

10. To submit bug fixes, changes, etc please open pull requests on the Github
    site.
