### When at the character creation menu, and when the character has been already named, 
the game will ask you to press <ENTER> to begin playing, which will *NOT WORK*, you will need
to press <SPACE> instead, then proceed as usual. ###

Note from J. Machete: I will try to solve this once I'm getting my hands full-dive into the code.
By now, it's the only occasion you will to press space.
