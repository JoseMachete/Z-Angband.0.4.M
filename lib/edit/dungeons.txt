# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the vanilla dungeon.

# 'L' is for levels and limits - min level, max level, dungeon chance,
# wilderness population and height, and room limits

# 'H' is for habitat flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many H:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'R' is for room type flags. These are the types of rooms that are
# allowed to appear in the dungeon. As many R:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'W' is for floor and wall feature overrides - floor, digable wall,
# permanent wall, and rubble

# 'w' is for stair feature overrides - up, down, quest, and pillar

# 'd' is for door feature overrides - closed, open, broken, and
# closed secret. Secret doors are always closed when found.  The 
# feature used with open secret doors is the base feature of the
# closed secret door.

# 'O' is for object theme.  The three numbers represent the percent
# chance to drop treasure, combat and magic items.  The chance to
# drop tools is defined as 100 - the sum of these three numbers.
# Note that monsters do not drop junk.  Junk can only be generated
# in the dungeon when you enter it.

# 'C' is for the chances that various things will appear - monsters,
# objects, doors, traps, rubble, stairs, and tunnels

# 'c' is for the chances that a level will be a special type - small
# levels, arena levels, cavern levels, labrinth levels, vault levels,
# and city levels.

# 'S' is for the first type of streamer that changes the wall type -
# feature, treasure_feature, streamer width, number of streamers, 
# and chance of treasure feature.

# 's' is for the second type of streamer that changes the wall type -
# feature, treasure_feature, streamer width, number of streamers, 
# and chance of treasure feature.

# 'V' is for the first type of river that may be generated - shallow
# water feature, deep water feature, rarity, and width.

# 'v' is for the second type of river that may be generated - shallow
# water feature, deep water feature, rarity, and width.

# 'l' is for a lake that may be generated - shallow
# feature, deep feature, rarity, and radius.

# 'n' is for a possible name given to the dungeon using the random
# name generator - chance, generator id, name format string. The name
# string allows a name from a name generator to be inserted into the
# string. For instance, "Mines of %s" might become "Mines of Bahzkhel",
# or "%s Tower" might become "Lauregaer Tower", or "%ssford" might
# become "Ronddalsford". The generator id is usually 0 to use the 
# elvish name generator. The other name generators are 1 - dwarvish.
# If not present all dungeons of the type will use the default name.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.


# Version stamp (required)
