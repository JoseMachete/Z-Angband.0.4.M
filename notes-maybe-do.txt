

  Maybe Todo:
    Finish enchant_pval? what is left to do?

    Be able to abandon a quest and get another from the same quest giver after
      a period of time. (cancel then insert a "wait" quest in the building?)

    Change spell gain for priests,paladins, and monks to be like spell gain
      for spellcasters? (for now I changed spell slots for priests, paladins,
      and monks back to 38, so they can get all of the spells in the life/death realms.)

      maybe change priest spellcasting so that they can cast any spell in a
      book that they have that is their level or lower. how should failure
      rates be handled?

    Be able to forget a spell and free up the spell slot (respec) Respec would
      be a service from an appropriate building (zygurmist or mage guild) and
      cost the cube of the number of spell slots used times the building cost
      factor. respec would be for mages only since priests paladins and monks
      can get all of their spells.

    Allow pets to travel through stairs with the player

    player made spell books?

    allow term windows to have a scroll bar

    have to buy homes not in the starting town (100,000 gold?)

    be able to change empty buildings to stores and upgrade them
      perhaps change blank spots and homes not is starting town to a blank store field
      then in the store purchase a building type. but in do_cmd_building() need
      to have a check if its owned by the player and show more options if it is
      (Upgrade, no longer own). Building price except home is 300,000 + 100,000*rarity?

    Change containers so that the player may not use the contents directly? so
      that the player is required to use a turn to remove an object to main
      inventory to use, identify, etc. Pickup direct to, fire from, inspect in
      container should still work without using energy.

    Neutral/Friendly townspeople can be generated at empty or blank buildings
      and stores and walk to another building in the town, where they disappear.
      Possibly select the person type based on the source or destination building.

    Magesmiths can "make" magic items. when the player selects the command,
      the store would create a randart. if the player does not want it, a
      different randart is offered next. if the player wants it, a series of
      quests is generated for the building, with the randart as the reward
      after all of the quests. every item shown should cost some gold (~item
      level in au? ~100au?) item level will be clvl + randrange(0, max(110, 2.5*clvl))?
      
      Most of the quests will be bounty quests for components used in making
      the item. a bank loan for more than the value of the randart should be
      one of the quests. or after all quests are done, the item is put on
      layaway? perhaps the number of bounty quests will be such that the
      levels of the monsters killed will be the square of the item level?
      (item level count of monsters whose level is equal to the item level)
      or 3d4 random bounty quests? if item level < 40?

      The player can also offer an item to be used as the base of the randart.
      Magesmith (armor) and Magesmith (weapon) will only offer appropriate
      items. need to add a magesmith (jewelery) for rings, amulets, lights, etc.

    if in stealth mode, player can pass through sleeping monsters. either by 
      skipping past their position or by switching places with them. I prefer
      the latter. or skip when there is only one monster in the way, for extra
      energy, and switch otherwise.

    be able to "pick up" tamed pets that were not summoned.

    allow platforms to override parts of the ui.

    add bank boxes to bank and change initial home to bank?

    reduce stuff in dun_type and refer to dun_gen_type instead.
      also be able to set dun_gen_type based on level range with/without
       changing habitat.

    make a stairs generate in the capital, to be the palace dungeon, and
     make it the angband dungeon type, with a level step of 10, min level
     10, and max level 120
      
    use angband lighting style (array[MAX_LIGHTING]) for feature and field
      lighting.

    possible start:
     You are from out of town. You heard that a fried/familty member was
      missing, so you came to town to find him/her. You get to town, find
      the house locked. while looking around town for information, you go
      town hall and the mayor tells you that the person has been missing
      for a while, and asks you to look for itb (get quest), and gives you
      the key. when you get to the house, you search around, then enter the
      cellar. There you find non-breeding vermin (probably snakes/lizards),
      and notes on gameplay (tutorial). You then find a note that says that
      the person heard of an artifact in the sewers and went to look for
      it. you can then either enter the sewers, or return to the mayor who
      will tell you to enter the sewers. Halfway down, level 10-15ish, you
      will find the persons body, a monster hero/unique, a good ego item, and a
      note talking about a more powerful item/hero at the bottom. Returning
      to the mayor (turning in the quest) after finding the body, the mayor
      expresses condolances and gives you the house. At this point, gameplay
      is normal.
     Or: You are from town (street urchin like?), and the mayor asks you to
      find a missing prominent resident, and gives you the key to their
      house. Then as above.
     Or if a night creature/monster: You bought a house in town. It was 
      cheap because the previous resident disappeared and everyone is afraid
      of the house, but you barely bought it. looking around the house, you
      find the cellar, then the note, then decide to find the artifact...
      No town hall quest, but start able to use the house, after finding the
      note, rather than after finding the body and turning in the quest.

    Add ability to draw a cave grid, rather than a couple attr/char pairs.

    want set of tiles per dungeon that use floor, wall, door (open, closed,
      broken), stair up, stair down
    add generation (incl. vault spec.) and redirection of fountain,
      window, wall support, and statue.


    Want new featue types: road a,b town ground a,b, 

    x?For find ruin quests, check if the place block is known first? I don't
      think quests should be given for known locations. Especially since
      mapmakers can now reveal the whole map.

    vault symbol changes:

#    = - secret door  formerly +

#    p - pattern start point
#    a-d - pattern path
#    P - pattern end - only heals once?
#    A - pattern ?? - normal floor - object 10 levels ood
#    B - pattern teleport point??
# A pattern point can only be stepped on from another feature if the feature
# stepped from has the pattern flag or if the feature stepped from is the
# floor and the feature with the index before the feature stepped to does
# not have the pattern flag. A pattern point does damage when stepped
# on unless the previous point has index-1.
# 
# A pattern end point may be stepped on from any feature between two pattern
# end points or that has the pattern flag.
# A pattern end point will heal when stepped on (once?) or use another
# feature for this (non-pattern)?
# need to hard code pattern start and pattern end? or use pattern|quest|trap
# to specify start, and pattern|quest to mark end?

    vault symbol additions:
#    Q - quest boss or item, or monster up to 9 levels OOD and treasure up to 7 levels OOD
#    < - preferred connection point for corridors, or entry stairs if vault is the level
#    > - exit stairs if vault is the level, or preferred connection point for corridors
#    * - vein (quartz or magma, whichever matches the most adjacent tiles?)

#    ~ - water (river1 type)
#    @ - water (lake type)
#    - - water hide monster? (up to 9 levels OOD?)

#    / - ramp up part
#    \ - ramp down part
#    o - nothing
#    , - fence? (border between floor and nothing)

# other symbols vault specific defined by:
#// V:<sym>:<type>:<id> where type is R, K, F, or T (or g for monster group)
# V:<sym>:<feat>:<feat_mod_flags>:<r_idx>:<k_idx>:<ego>:<trap>? from Z2.4.0
# if r_idx < 0 make hero from -r_idx
# if k_idx < 0 make randart from -k_idx
# if ego > 0, if k_idx > 0, use k_idx as base if appropiate tval for ego
# if ego > 0, if k_idx < 0, make randart that includes ego
# if ego > 0, if k_idx = 0, pick random object for ego
# if ego < 0 make artifact from -ego?
# if r_idx, k_idx, or trap start with '*', then the number means out of depth rather than index 
# M: Message that replaces the normal level feeling?
# N:y:x:notefeat:note - message that comes up when steping on the spot (bumping into if wall)
FA/DaJangband have extra vault types/chars incorporate, modify above?

add vault symbol like line that makes a specific item/creature spawn elsewhere
on the level (next to entry point if nowhere else possible). the idea is to make
an item generate that would get the player through a feature of the vault by a
feature change, but the item would not be nearby. (R for remote?)

add easier depth level symbols, so alot can be used.
  i - monster up to 15 levels over depth?
  j - monster up to 15 levels over depth, object up to 20 levels over depth?
 just use v lines and r_idx is *-overdepth, ie V:i:1:0:*-15



  Stuff I decided not to do:
    change chests so that they are containers, and their objects are generated
      at drop? now that items depend on depth the chest was found at, this is
      too much work for too little gain.
