

  Maybe Todo:
    Finish enchant_pval? what is left to do?

    When you die you loose 10% of total exp? 25%?

    Be able to abandon a quest and get another from the same quest giver after
      a period of time.

    Change spell gain for priests,paladins, and monks to be like spell gain
      for spellcasters? (for now I changed spell slots for priests, paladins,
      and monks back to 38, so they can get all of the spells in the life/death realms.)

    Be able to forget a spell and free up the spell slot (respec)

    Allow pets to travel through stairs with the player

    player made spell books?

    allow term windows to have a scroll bar

    have to buy homes not in the starting town (100,000 gold?)

    be able to change empty buildings to stores and upgrade them
      perhaps change blank spots and homes not is starting town to a blank store field
      then in the store purchase a building type. but in do_cmd_building() need
      to have a check if its owned by the player and show more options if it is
      (Upgrade, no longer own). Building price except home is 300,000 + 100,000*rarity?

    Change containers so that the player may not use the contents directly? so
      that the player is required to use a turn to remove an object to main
      inventory to use, identify, etc. Pickup direct to, fire from, inspect in
      container should still work without using energy.

    want set of tiles per dungeon that use floor, wall, door (open, closed,
      broken), stair up, stair down
    add generation (incl. vault spec.) and redirection of fountain,
      window, wall support, and statue.


    Want new featue types: road a,b town ground a,b, 

    x?For find ruin quests, check if the place block is known first? I don't
      think quests should be given for known locations. Especially since
      mapmakers can now reveal the whole map.

    Show time of day text under main screen? where? (from turn (of 10000)):
      Sunrise (0)
      Morning (833)
      Late Morning (1667)
      Noon (2500)
      Afternoon (3333)
      Late Afternoon (4167)
      Sunset (5000)
      Evening(5833)
      Late Evening (6667)
      Midnight(7500)
      Late Night(8333)
      Predawn(9167)
    Only in Wilderness?(replace wilderness name) Night creatures still get
      bonus in dungeons so no. After tile multipliers, put to right of
      wilderness name and don't care if it is shown or not.

# on unless the previous point has index-1.
# 
# A pattern end point may be stepped on from any feature between two pattern
# end points or that has the pattern flag.
# A pattern end point will heal when stepped on (once?) or use another

# M: Message that replaces the normal level feeling?
FA/DaJangband have extra vault types/chars incorporate, modify above?


  Stuff I decided not to do:
    change chests so that they are containers, and their objects are generated
      at drop? now that items depend on depth the chest was found at, this is
      too much work for too little gain.
