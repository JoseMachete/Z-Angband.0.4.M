    add random approximate level bounty quests back to castle. this would be
      generated on the fly with quest levels .9*plvl - 1.5*plvl. rewards only
      gold and xp, no items. maybe add to alchemists as well? (rare potion ingredients)

    Finish enchant_pval? what is left to do?

    Be able to abandon a quest and get another from the same quest giver after
      a period of time.

    Change spell gain for priests,paladins, and monks to be like spell gain
      for spellcasters? (for now I changed spell slots for priests, paladins,
      and monks back to 38, so they can get all of the spells in the life/death realms.)

    Be able to forget a spell and free up the spell slot (respec)

    Allow pets to travel through stairs with the player

    Default weights for classes during autoroll?

    allow term windows to have a scroll bar

    have to buy homes not in the starting town (100,000 gold?)

    be able to change empty buildings to stores and upgrade them
      perhaps change blank spots and homes not is starting town to a blank store field
      then in the store purchase a building type. but in do_cmd_building() need
      to have a check if its owned by the player and show more options if it is
      (Upgrade, no longer own). Building price except home is 300,000 + 100,000*rarity?

    Change containers so that the player may not use the contents directly? so
      that the player is required to use a turn to remove an object to main
      inventory to use, identify, etc. Pickup direct to, fire from, inspect in
      container should still work without using energy.

    change chests so that they are containers, and their objects are generated at drop

    want set of tiles per dungeon that use floor, wall, door (open, closed,
      broken), stair up, stair down

    Want new featue types: road a,b town ground a,b, 

    x?For find ruin quests, check if the place block is known first? I don't
      think quests should be given for known locations. Especially since
      mapmakers can now reveal the whole map.

    Show time of day text under main screen? where? (from turn (of 10000)):
      Sunrise (0)
      Morning (833)
      Late Morning (1667)
      Noon (2500)
      Afternoon (3333)
      Late Afternoon (4167)
      Sunset (5000)
      Evening(5833)
      Late Evening (6667)
      Midnight(7500)
      Late Night(8333)
      Predawn(9167)
    Only in Wilderness?(replace wilderness name) Night creatures still get
      bonus in dungeons so no. After tile multipliers, put to right of
      wilderness name and don't care if it is shown or not.

    Move dungeon type info from tables.c (line 5191) to a file (dungeons.txt and dungeons.raw)
      use dun_gen_type structure
      since we have seperate attr/char pairs for each lighting level in
        features, remove the USE_TRANS flag and add EXIT_DOWN and EXIT_UP flags
        also add QUEST_DOWN flag.
      add door, stair, and pillar redirection (8 more bytes per type)
      add generation (incl. vault spec.) and redirection of rubble, 
        fountain, window, wall support, and statue.
