The is my personal copy of z+angband. It is based on z+angband 0.3.3beta.

It has some severe balance changes from the released Z+, some of which may
or may not work. Some notes about my changes area in notes_changes.txt. Some
of my notes about things I am thinking about doing are in notes_maybe_do.txt.

Some of these changes are not well tested.

The makefiles may or may not work, since I have added and removed files.
With an IDE, you might want to follow the visual studio step by step,
which is in this directory.

I am using a version number of 0.3.4 to distinguish it from the original.

The orignial readme for Z+Angband 0.3.3beta is in z_readme.
