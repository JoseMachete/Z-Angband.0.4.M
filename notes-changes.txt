These are changes to the released source made over time from zAngband 2.7.4 to z+Angband 0.3.3beta.

My second commit added all of these to my copy of 0.3.3 at once. When
MangoJuice releases a 0.3.4, I am intending to overwrite all this and
add my changes back in peice by piece.  Using commits for each item, 
MangoJuice or a contributor would be able to remove any of my
controversial changes, especially balance changes like the infuse
magic scrolls and general backpacks.
  
    Added corrosion resistance scroll and potion as mid-level items to
      k_info.txt, and updated misc.txt with the new item count. (zpa has 
      scroll of rustproofing, but the above is still in anyways)

    On a bounty quest, it now lists the monster symbol, to facilitate looking the monster up in a library.(on new quests)

    You set a home to go to when you cast word of recall in the wilderness (and go to it)
      The save file version number has been incremented, for backwards compatibility.
      uses the first 4 bytes of the 48 byte future use area

    Gave dungeons a bit more flavored place names on wilderness map
      zpa is overwriting this, move name_dungeons somewhere else? - fixed in maid-grf

    Gave monster camps names on wilderness map

    Adjusted player birth so that if you know your desired starting
      values, before the race and class bonuses, you can set them directly,
      instead of auto roll. This is done using the autoroll weights. The
      values should add up to 86.

    Changed create_city() to replace basic temples with higher level ones, if
      there are several basic temples, because I had not seen the higher
      level ones in my games. (not needed because zpa has better building
      distribution, but still in anyways, just in case.)

    Map makers will reveal the whole wilderness map, if you pay them 30 times
      their normal amount, or 150,000 gold, whichever is greater. Cheap stores
      may only charge 100,000 gold. (for zpa, changed in t_info.txt) all the
      map makers are charging 100,000 gold?

    You can now access knowledge menu from wilderness map using '~' or '|'.
    Switched some lines, so pressing '*' when not on a town does not leave map.
      zpa town commands are also trapped, for the same reason

    Added ability to recall creature symbols from the knowledge menu

    Added commands to go back a full page and go back a single line in some
      menus. (changes were made to show_file())

    You can now rest in homes, to either dawn or dusk, depending on the time.
      The rest command is on line 25, so if you have a 24 line display, it
      will not show up. Press 'R' to rest.

    You can eat from inventory in homes, using do_cmd_eat_food.
      does not allow food in the home to be selected. Press 'E' to eat.

    Changed some grammar in roff_mon_aux() when there are more than 2 items.
      change was to add commas where they should be.

    Added a scroll (Infuse Magic) to increase the pval of an item, used the code
      from enchant armor, but the scroll level and stats should be the same as
      Acquirement - enchant_pval function partly done. Manually added lua binding.

    Added habitat text to monster description in roff_mon_aux() to make it
      worthwhile to research in library for bounty quests

    Added code to create_towns, to force a library to be created, if one was
      not created already. It first looks at the largest city and put it into
      a blank spot. If a blank spot is not found, the code tries a bunch of
      random places. This code will fail only if there are no places with 
      blank spots, or that the random part does not try the place. Both 
      fails are extremely rare. If no town has a library, all I can say is to
      try to find a shadow jump scroll or do without the library, but again
      this case is *extremely* rare.

    Added a scroll (level 35/8:60/4:80/1) and Amberite power(level 35, cost 100) 
      called Shadow Walk(or Shadow Jump), which resets the wilderness and the
      monster camps. The player's inventory and the inventory of the main home
      are preserved. To save the player's inventory, I needed to remove a line
      from wipe_all_lists() and add it at the other place the function is used.
      To save the inventory of the player's main house, I needed to change how
      wipe_o_list works a bit. there are probably still memory leaks
      associated with this. (so save and reload game after jumping?)
      Manually added lua binding.
      TODO Still need to clear quest and monstor questors, clear unique
      monster kills, clear any artifacts not in the players inventory.

    Changed draw_general() to store a position for empty buildings and blank
      spots, because the memory is being used anyways, and the info could be
      used in the future. Perhaps to buy homes or other buildings.

    Added a simple object list. It is displayed just below the monster list. 
      Does not check for mimics yet. changed put_object, delete_dungeon_object,
      delete_object, and display_visable. added display_visable_obejcts and
      display_visable_item. When the list updates objects are listed from
      closest to farthest, up to range 19. When the list updates, the monster
      list updates as well (and vice versa). objects already on ground do not
      show up until an object is dropped or picked up (To keep update count
      down?). also, gold is not shown. (because of the item_tester_okay in
      test floor) need visable update when objects go into and out of los?

    item_tester_okay only checks if first item in a container is okay, reversed
      check and result, so it returns true if all items are okay. (but this
      section is not used anyways)

    increased power of *enchant* scrolls so that they always have an effect
      increased cost to 10000, rarity to 50/3:70/1

    changed containers so that in k_info.txt (and object_can_contain)
      pval is the maximum weight that can be in the container in tenths
      zpa has pval as the max number of ammo that can be held, but weight is more
        general for containers
      ac is the maximum number of lines in the container
      to_d is the minimum tval of potential contents
      to_a is the maximum tval of potential contents
      to_h is an extra tval for something not in the range between to_d and to_a
      if to_a is 0 then anything can be put into the container, except if it is
       in the range between to_h and to_d
      with these changes, need to change how the container line is displayed
       to not show the to_h,to_d, and to_a - done
      if another tval is needed, then the number of lines (stacks) can be hard
       coded (to 23?) and ac used for another tval.
      *need container support in shadow jump?
      *weight limits are not working?

    Added containers to item_tester_hook_organizable, so that containers will
      show up in the initial organize list, to remove items from (moving to *)

    Implemented 4 sizes of jewelry pouches, food sacks, and weapon belts. Also
      a high level general backpack.

    Added a second backup to rotate with for autosave_b. tests if autosave_freq
      is odd or even when deciding which suffix to use, and adds or subtracts 1
      so that the other suffix would be used next time. odd is even+1

    Added the ability to load a PNG tileset. support is through both DirectX and
      libPNG. The directx version will load any file format that DirectX9 supports.
      the libPNG version will fall back to read bmp if it fails.

    In graf.prf files, added a flag to T: and F: lines, flag can be l or L
      l forces the tile to be used without dynamic support, whatever t_info.txt or 
      f_info.txt says. L forces dynamic lighting on. (in the future, for R:
      lines, the flag O will tell the program to show the tile with overdraw.
      This means that the program will show the tile above it in the tileset
      in the tile above on screen. Same for T:, F:, and K: lines. not
      implemented yet. need a flag to set in monster_kind? or some flag that
      persists and can get to term_pict_win. Perhaps a structure like Angband's
      grid_data struct, and pass this structure to all of the term_pict_xxx functions.)
     Undid above for F: lines. F: lines are now like in FAangband
       (F:<normal>{:<dark>{:<bright>}}) where normal, dark, and bright are the
       tile coordinates or color/character pair for that lighting type. T: lines
       do not use lighting anyways? so not changed. * fields have a 
       FIELD_INFO_TRANS flag, what does it do? it can use dynamic lighting
       through a feat (~line 2233 in maid-grf.c) * change to match

    In pref files added a gender test, for future female player character tiles.
      [EQU $GENDER Male] or [EQU $GENDER Female]

    In pref files added a player name test, for those who want more specific
      user pref files. [EQU $PLAYERNAME Corwin] or [EQU $PLAYERNAME Torg] not tested yet.
      what happens with spaces in the name?
      I think $PLAYER is the name of the save file? (player_base)
      redirections/changes would have to be made manually?

    Added random approximate level bounty quests back to castles and if a member,
      guilds. levels range from plevel-5 to (plevel-5)*2. ranger guilds have a 10%
      chance of offering find place quests (if not everything has been found),
      mage and thief guilds have a 10% chance of offering find artifact quests,
      as does the large castle. Bounties are offered only if the building does
      not have any other quest available. If on a appropiate level twice as
      deep as quest level, all remaining creatures for bounty are generated.
      rewards only gold and xp, no items. maybe add to alchemists as well? (rare
      potion ingredients)


    Wrote a tile picker. can load the working tiles and pref file, also tiles and 
        pref file for 2 placeholder sources.
      matches hard coded strings in the tile filename "32x32", "16x16", 8x8" to 
        get the tile size. can also parse filename of format XxY.bmp. only looks
        for mask in XxYmsk.bmp.
      can pick a cell to assign an item from the working tiles. the top left cell is
        considdered to be not assigned.
      can mark an item as using placeholder artwork, so it is listed in a seperate
        list. "^" is the placeholder character and can appear anywhere in the
        comments for that item. either on the same line as the item, after the item
        or the whole line before the item. item must be assigned a cell to be
        considered to have placeholder artwork.
      can view the tiles and copy a tile and its mask from a source to the working
        set. from p1, pick, place, and mark that its a placeholder. From p2, just place.
      can swap tiles, including masks, with the one left of it, and save it in
        the working tiles. (Ctrl-P)
      can middle click on a tile to select what uses it in the main window.
        (left click to center the display on the click spot, right click to
        select a tile to be assigned or overwritten by a placeholder.)
      can save a 32bit png with transparency by clearing the mask name before
        the save as command, or by selecting "no, then "cancel" when it asks
        to confirm/pick the mask name during a "save as" command.
      *edit note is not working. notes are in parentheses after the comments
        on the same line or the previous one in the pref file. "# name (note)"
        notes are everything between the first open and the last close paren,
        *so need to rename items that have parentheses in their names,
        otherwise the part of the name in parens is taken to be the note, and
        keeps being added on repeated load-save-quit  cycles. or change to brackets.
      *need to be able to type in the coordinates.
      can load/save DaJAngband info/pref files? "DaJAngband" must appear
        somewhere in the path of what is selected in the initial open dialog
        box. Possibly a dummy file in the edit directory.
      can load/save Angband info/pref files? "Angband" or "angband" must appear
        somewhere in the path of what is selected in the initial open dialog
        box. Possibly a dummy file in the edit directory.
      for the above two lines, looks for ./lib/edit/terrain.txt, and if found
        looks for the game name in the path, and does not present the initial
        open dialog box.
      loads flags from an ini file that tell how to load pref files, and which
        file names to use, so the game name does not need to be in the path.
        flags = 0 for zpa, 847 for angband. the ini file is written using flags
        determined from the file path when the tile picker is run and the ini
        file does not exist.

    Changed F: lines in graf-new to add specific dark/bright tiles, same for
      graf-dvg_mod.pref. graf-old.prf is fine since the original tiles do not
      have shades for the dynamic lighting, and my changes are an extension,
      not a replacement.
      changed all references to a graphics mode (use_graphics == XXX to use_graphics > 1)
        except those in the main-xxx.c files and maid-grf.c, the the GRAF test in files.c
      *need to implement for fields and change some T: lines similarly.
        especially for graf-new, which has shades for traps.

    Expanded feature_type structure. added base_feat, priority, and dig. also
      changed flags to 32 bits (from 8 bits). added flags to tell what can be
      done to the feat. changed many tests for a specific feature to a test for
      a flag expected in the feature. esp in do_cmd_tunnel, do_cmd_open, and
      do_cmd_close. changed f_info to add/change/remove flags as appropiate.
      with the base_feat variable the feat gets switched to the base feat if has flags:
        HIDDEN - switched when searched
        DOOR,CLOSED not hidden or broken - switched when opened
        DOOR not hidden or broken - switched when closed
        DIG - switched when tunneled, if any of above, switch with floor
        OVERLAY - same as above but draw both, if any of above, switch with floor on destruction
        TRAP - done as a field, so nothing to do. remove the flag possibility?
      if a feature has DIG_GOLD, DIG_OBJ, DIG_CUSTOM, or DIG_FOOD, the object
        is placed when the feature is searched or dug through, depending on if
        the feat has the DIG flag or the HIDDEN flag. * add for CLOSED too?
        but closed assumes closed, open pair of feats that will always switch
        between each other? * move code to place_feat_object(featue_type *f_ptr)
        and put fn in appropiate places (tunnel, search, open?).
      outside of generation, redirection, and pattern tiles, there should not
        be tests for specific feats? or tests should use the_feat(feat) for 
        possible redirection? (also use the_floor(),the_wall(),the_perm_wall())

      all flags are:

    *added FA flags that seem interesting, not used yet (used all flag and flag2 bits)

     *finish working on project_f

    Chest items now depend on the depth the chest was found at, rather than
      the difficulty level of the chest's trap. The level used is the average
      of the depth the chest was found at and the native depth of the chest.

    vault symbol changes:

    modified main map display so it always uses tile multipliers of 1, whether
      or not bigtile mode is used.

    Move dungeon type info from tables.c (line 5191) to a file (dungeons.txt and dungeons.raw)
      use dun_gen_type structure
      since we have seperate attr/char pairs for each lighting level in
        features, remove the USE_TRANS flag and add EXIT_DOWN and EXIT_UP flags
        also add QUEST_DOWN flag.
      added door, stair, rubble, and pillar redirection (8 more bytes per type)
      added dungeon index and level step to dungeon structure
      added new features and test graphics for cavern and mine dungeons
      added new features and test graphics for graveyard doors
      added new features and test graphics for horror/pit dungeons
      added new features and test graphics for temple/city dungeons

    renamed edit files not used by tilepicker to more readable name.

    added a graphics mode array that is populated from a text file for
      less hardcoded graphics.

    added some code, not tested yet, to specify the damage multiplier on bows.

    moved wilderness and field array initialization from play_game() to init_angband()

    gave empty buildings a door in preparation of being able to buy buildings

    zymurgists will fully identify an item for a lot of gold (6 times what
      they charge to identify a pack).

    dungeons can skip levels within their range. the dungeon level skip is
      given just after the max dungeon level in the dungeon type info.
      *Tested with sewers, but what happens around dl 99,100 has not been tested.
      *need to adjust for dungeon guard quests, which test for a specific level.

    added functions to load a graphics list from a text file, like I wrote for angband.

    store and save the largest town, so a castle in it could be used as a palace for quest purposes.
    store and save the number of owned buildings and death chests, for future use.

    players can deposit and withdraw gold from banks.
    fixed bank loan quest (a quest known flag was missing where the quest was inserted).
    Added ability to store an item from stores and pay for it later in banks.
     make sure you have space in your pack for it, or you will be charged an
     additional 50 gold. Warning: once you buy an item on lay away, you cannot
     buy another on lay away until the first one has been paid for.

    bounty quest rewards no longer give stat gain.

    fixed display of building options, and some lines that were being distorted
      by the cursor changing position in term_erase in term_bigtile_expand.

    *created bulding list for empty buildings. (still can't buy them though.)

    adjusted the default weights of the autoroller by the class stat bonus.

    added additional modes (swing and stealth) through the toggle search key.
      swing mode uses available blows to attack multiple adjacent enemies.
       warriors get bonus attacks, representing an extra length of swing.
      stealth mode provide a 7% bonus to stealth when active. rangers get a
       10% bonus and rogues get a 14% bonus. (+1 for rounding, approx +10%)
      to use, press the toggle search button (shift-s) within 2 seconds of the
       previous press of the toggle search button. After two seconds, pressing
       it turns any mode off.
      the additional modes use the same speed penalty as search mode. (half
       with no speed bonus)

    Added items to resurrect the player when s/he dies.
     *still need to remove gold/items from the player and put in a "death
      chest", which would appear on the level the player was killed on. and
      keep appearing each time level is visited, until the chest is opened
      (emptied?). probably use a grave graphic.
     *players lose 25% of their total exp (atleast 1 level) when a
      resurrection item is used. change to 10% when death chests are added?

    gave spellcasters a bit more starting mana

    added a word of recall scroll to starting items for all characters so the
     player can start diving earlier.

    *added ability to play repeated games without exiting on Windows (from Sil)
     includes use of keyboard presses for the options. *not quite working yet.

    *Added support for tile multipliers larger than 2x1. Mostly working. Screen
     just to the right of the map is not being cleared though.
     *some messages have blank spots in them. the messages in the message 
      sub window are ok though. *need to change screen setup to be similar 
      to angband, for context menus in the middle of the screen and the screen
      not changing when a few of the map lines are overwriten with text.
     *X11 crashes when the tile height multiplier is > 1

    Added time of day text on the status bar. It is displayed to the right of
     the dungeon level / place name, if the screen is large enough (>90 chars).

    *Added basic mouse support. 
     *need to implement context menus.

    Added a pathfinding run mode.
    *Started adding additional run modes to follow roads and waterways

    *Added mouse buttons in most screens. the buttons are "on top" of text in 
      the screen, always on top of the list of possible keys, and they send the
      keypress.
     *need to add more buttons, esp for targeting/looking
     *Added main screen buttons, but some of them are not in obvious places.
      clicking on search changes the search mode, clicking on study tries to
      study a book. clicking on the place name/dungeon level shows the map. if
      the broad time of day is shown, clicking on it gives the detailed time
      of day. In the info panel, clicking on the equipment line shows the
      inventory. clicking the race to class title lines shows the character
      screen. clicking the left side of the level to gold lines will use an
      item from inventory. clicking the right side will cast magic if possible.
      clicking the left side of the ac to sp lines will wield an item. clicking
      the right side will take an item off.
      *still need target current target/show monster list.

    Got the X11 console/graphics working again. Added png and tile mask file
      support. Added ability to load/save a settings file.
      *need to add a system menu.

    Allow mouse wheel to scroll some menus, ie it can change the character
      screen. added to X11 and Windows.

    Gave some stores a service to make more of ammo the player already has.
      for instance, if in a fletcher, and sell two ammo out of a stack, 20
      appear in the store? (so need to have at least 3 in inventory) so far
      just arcane/unique flether. *potions and scrolls too?

    Allow for smaller levels and slower breeders in clearout quests.

  Stuff I did for zAngband, but are not needed for z+Angband
    *Changed do_cmd_knowledge_objects() and print_monster_string() to use the
      default text character, instead of the icon character, because the 
      icon character crashes the program for me. It appears froff does not
      know how to deal with the icon information.
    xWhen you list your quests, it now lists the city you got the quest from.(on new quests)
      for message, defender, bounty, find place, find item. What else are requested?
      zpa - all quests are generated at the beginning? does this put an extra
      starting town name in the quest name? yes, also zpa has its own place/building line
      message so this should be removed - changes undone
    xOn a message quest, it now lists if you have delivered the message, but not gotten your reward.(on new quests)
    xChanged add_monsters to have a 20% chance to force bountied creatures
      to spawn in an underground dungeon level of the right level and habitat.
      The bountied monsters also have a 20% chance to spawn on the bottom
      level, for the smaller dungeons types. A message will be given if 
      it is generated. ("Your pulse quickens.") zpa - similar already done except message
    xOn Relic quests, changed it so that the artifact may be generated on any
      level below (higher number) the artifact's level. Each level has a 10%
      chance of it being generated on that level. It will always be generated
      at least on the bottom level. A message will be given if it is generated.
    xChanged library function (research_mon) so that it adds a sighting to the 
      viewed monster if there is not one. (so the info can be recalled in the
      normal recall commands.)

  Stuff I was thinking for zAngband, but are not needed for z+Angband
    XIf all of the monster camps have been completed, once per day, there
      should be a 1% chance of one of the camps respawning and the quest resetting.
      In zpa, camps are never cleared.
    xPerhaps move changes from add_monsters in generate.c to activate_quest in
      quest.c? - already done by zpa
    Xadd a quest list (ctrl-Q) to the possible lists in recall symbol, for both
      knowledge menu and libraries
    XPut a trashcan chest on every level, to move destroyed non-worthless objects into?
    xCommand to center the current block in the view? if automatic, it would
      slow the program a bit, because of the additional graphics updates.


  Stuff that I changed but later reverted
    Tile Picker:
      Ctrl-P double swap tiles, used to rearrange from adam bolt lighting to
        david geravis lighting, also adjusts assigned cell for all three tiles.
        - removed since dynamic lighting works differently now and there is no
        need to adjust the Adam Bolt tiles
      when loading tiles you should always use bmp file for both color and mask
        unless you are very sure you will not save the tiles, because it has
        trouble saving as png. it always saves both color and mask as 24 bits.
        - uses libPNG to save, and is more reliable
    Reduced chance of bounty being forced to spawn on an appropiate level to 20%
      also made message show all the time when a bounty  monster is generated.
      reverted back to 50% since only one is generated at a time. Since then 
      allow up to a third of what remains to be generated
    Allow specifing which graphic files load with a pref line: 
      I:<elementwidth>:<elementheight>:<filename>{:<filemaskname>}
      rather than the hard coded sizes and file names in maid-win.c and maid-grf.c
      .prf files are read in reset_visuals,so need to make sure the images are loaded
      after reset_visuals is called. I have not changed the code for platforms
      other than Windows. * this will be reverted and the code will be changed to load
      a graphics list from a text file, like I wrote for angband.
      removed and added a graphics mode array that will eventually be populated from
      a text file.
    Also, added a number based test the graf test. So instead of none,old,new,david
      you would have 0,1,2,3. so $GRAF new would be $GRAFC 2
      in the ini file, there is a line Graphics = <number> use this number
      with the [EQU $GRAFC <number>] test in graf-win.prf. Works so don't need
      to recompile except to add a number to the graphics list, which we don't
      need to do if we do not change the graphics. I left $GRAF in for backwards
      compatibility. * this will be reverted and the code will be changed to load
      a graphics list from a text file, like I wrote for angband.
